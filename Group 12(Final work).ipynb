    "\n",
    "As it was shown in classes, graph databases are a natural way of navegating related information. For this first project we will be taking a graph database to analyse beer and breweries!   \n",
    "\n",
    "The project datasets are based on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ehallmar/beers-breweries-and-beer-reviews), released by Evan Hallmark. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem description\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are working in the Data Management department of Analytics company.\n",
    "Explore the database via python neo4j connector and/or the graphical tool in the NEO4J webpage. Answer the questions while adjusting the database to meet the needs of your colleagues.\n",
    "Please record and keep track of your database changes, and submit the file with all cells run and with the output shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explore the database: get familiar with current schema, elements and other important database parameters. [1 point]\n",
    "2. Adjust the database and mention reasoning behind: e.g. clean errors, remove redundancies, adjust schema as necessary. Visualize the final version of database schema. [4 points]\n",
    "3. Analytics department requires the following information for the biweekly reporting: [5 points]\n",
    "    1. How many reviews has the beer with the most reviews?\n",
    "    2. Which three users wrote the most reviews about beers?\n",
    "    3. Find all beers that are described with following words: 'fruit', 'complex', 'nutty', 'dark'.\n",
    "    4. Which top three breweries produce the largest variety of beer styles?\n",
    "    5. Which country produces the most beer styles?\n",
    "4. Market Analysis department in your company accesses and updates the trends data on the daily basis. Given that, consider how you need to optimize the database and its performance so that the following queries are efficient. Measure performance to communicate your improvements using PROFILE before final query. Answer the following: [4 points]\n",
    "    1. Using ABV score, find five strongest beers, display their ABV score and the corresponding brewery? Keep in mind that the strongest known beer is Snake Venom, and deal with the error entries in the database.\n",
    "    2. Using the answer from question 2, find the top 5 distict beer styles with the highest average score of smell + feel that were reviewed by the third most productive user. Keep in mind that cleaning the database earlier should ensure correct results.\n",
    "5. Answer **two out of four** of the following questions using Graph Algorithms (gds): [NB: make sure to clear the graph before using it again] For the quarterly report, Analytics department the follownig information. [6 points]\n",
    "    1. Which two countries are most similiar when it comes to their top five most produced Beer styles?\n",
    "    2. Which beer is the most popular when considering the number of users who reviewed it? \n",
    "    3. Users are connected together by their reviews of beers, taking into consideration the \"smell\" score they assign as a weight, how many communities are formed from these relationships? How many users are in the three largest communities? \n",
    "    4. Which user is the most influential when it comes to reviews of distinct beers by style?\n",
    " \n",
    "### Groups  \n",
    "\n",
    "Groups should have 4 people maximum. Please mark which group you are here: https://shorturl.at/zE0QP \n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission      \n",

    "The code used to produce the results and to-the-point explations should be uploaded to moodle. They should have a clear reference to the group, either on the file name or on the document itself. Preferably one Jupyter notebook per group.\n",

In turn, brewers decided to craft ales with very high malt bills, thus yielding the strong, malty, and sweet flavors that have become hallmarks of the Scottish Ale style. By the mid-19th century, Edinburgh was acknowledged as one of the foremost brewing cities in the world, a fact that any proud Scotsman would be honored to flaunt. The flavor of this rich, full-bodied ale stems from the malt profile, which exhibits complex notes of roasted and caramelized barley, dried dark fruit, chocolate, toasted nuts, and a faint hint of smoke.'>,\n",

This is what we like to drink. We like dry, balanced, drinkable, tart beers with some interesting yeast complexity. We feel we‚Äôve achieved this with Black Metal, and hope others enjoy it as well. There will be those that don‚Äôt, however, and wish we‚Äôd return to the days of fermenting this beer with English ale yeast, and that‚Äôs OK.'>,\n",

To the nose, caramel malts meet toasted spices with additional notes of chestnut and plum. Tastes of sweet caramel and butterscotch hit the palate first, followed by biscuit graininess, fruit, vanilla, rye, and spices. A nice hop bite comes forward mid-palate and lasts on the tongue. This medium to full-bodied ale is creamy and sweet with a lingering hoppy aftertaste.'>,\n",

      " <Record Beer='10th Anniversary Thunder Hop IPA' Description='We are ready to unveil our anniversary beer. It is called Thunder Hop IPA. Many people are familiar with the pale ale variety called India Pale Ale a.k.a. IPA. This style was originally brewed by the 19th century British brewers for export to their troops stationed in India. Since it had to survive the 6 month trip in the hold of a ship, it contained more alcohol and a lot more hops than a typical Pale Ale. Hops and alcohol helped to prevent spoilage that might have ruined a batch of this precious brew. The Thunder Hop IPA is an American IPA which is an emerging style created by hop loving brewers. It has intense bitterness, flavor and aroma. We chose to use three varieties of American hops in the brewing process. The color is copper to amber, just a bit darker than the Pipe Organ Pale Ale. The aroma is noticeably hoppy due to the use of Sterlings in the dry hop process . You will also pick up a complexity from fruit-like esters. The body is big and malty with some caramel sweetness. You won\\x92t have to wait long for the finish, it comes Thundering in with intense bitterness. '>]\n"
